# ML_Diabetes_Classifier
A Project on Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Diabetes Classification.

### Project Timeline
Project created for University of Barcelona module "AI for Biomedical Engineering" in 2023 Semester 2.

### Dataset description.
Diabetes dataset downloaded from Kaggle.com. The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

The following are the Features content of the dataset (All numerical attributes)
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1)
  
### Objectives 
***Main Aim***: to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes or not.

***Exploratory objectives***: 
- Perform pre-processing and feature engineering when necessary.
- Use feature classification algorithms and explain importance using known literature.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of AI-based algorithms for classification tasks such as the one presented in this project.
